      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>The purpose of my website is to provide useful information for the proper selection of electric motors.
        A short and precise description will be given of the most important characteristics to take into account to acquire an electric motor and what are the main manufacturing standards.
        Images of the various types of electric induction motors, frame, dimensions, torque curves - speed, starting current, design NEMA, etc. will also be included. One of the child pages 
        will be used for motors under the IEC standard and the other for motors under the NEMA standard.

        The motor frame size.
        The electric motor is a machine capable of converting electrical energy into mechanical 
        energy. The induction motor is the most widely used type of motor because it combines 
        all the advantages offered by the electrical energy such as low cost, easy of supply and 
        distribution, clean handling and simple controls - together with those of simple construction 
        and its great versatility to be adapted to wide ranges of loads and improved efficiencies.
        The most widely used type of electric motor for driving a hydraulic pump is the 3-phase, 
        squirrel cage induction motor, with Design B electrical characteristics. It is available 
        in open drip-proof, totally enclosed, and explosion proof frames. Information in this issue 
        is concerned with frame assignments and with the dimensions of shaft length, diameter, and 
        height above base.
        A key part of motor interchangeability has been the standardization of frame sizes. 
        This means that the same horsepower, speed, and enclosure will normally have the same 
        frame size from different motor manufacturers. Thus, a motor from one manufacturer 
        can be replaced with a similar motor from another company provided they are both in 
        standard frame sizes.

      <h3>The Motors NEMA</h3>
      <p>
        The motors NEMA.
        A important achievement has been the standardization of motors by the National 
        Electric Manufacturers Association (NEMA).
        Motors, like suits of clothes, shoes and hats, come in various sizes to match the 
        requirements of the application. In general, the frame size gets larger with increasing 
        horsepowers or with decreasing speeds. In order to promote standardization in the motor 
        industry, NEMA (National Electrical Manufacturers Association) prescribes standard frame 
        sizes for certain dimensions of standard motors. For example, a motor with a frame size 
        of 56, will always have a shaft height above the base of 3-1/2 inches.
        The standardization effort over the last forty years has resulted in one original 
        grouping of frame sizes called “original”. In 1952, new frame assignments were made. 
        These were called “U frames”. The current “T frames” were introduced in 1964. 
        “T” frames are the current standard and most likely will continue to be for some time 
        in the future. Even though “T” frames were adopted in 1964, there are still a great 
        many “U” frame motors in service that will have to be replaced in the future.

      <h3>The Motors IEC</h3>
      <p>
        The motors IEC.
        Dimensions of electric motors are standardized according to the standard International 
        Electrotechnical Commission - IEC-60072. In these standards the basic dimension for the 
        standardization of the assembly dimensions of electric machines is the height from the 
        base to the shaft end center, designated by the letter H.
        To each height of shaft end H, a C dimension is associated, distance from the centerline of 
        mounting hole in the nearest foot to the shoulder on drive end shaft. However, to each H 
        dimension, several B dimension can be associated (distance between centerlines of mounting 
        holes in feet), allowing to have either “longer” or “shorter” motors.
        The "A" dimension, distance between centerlines of mounting holes in the feet or base of 
        machine, on the front side, is unique for H values up to 315, however it can have multiple 
        values from frame size H equal to 35 mm. For those customers who require standardized frames 
        size according to NEMA standard, the next table makes a comparison between dimensions H-A-B-C-K-D-E 
        of IEC standard and D; 2E; 2F; BA; H; U-N-W of NEMA standard.
