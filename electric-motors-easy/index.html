            <section class="msg1">
                <h3>The motor frame size </h3>
                <p>The electric motor is a machine capable of converting electrical energy into mechanical 
                    energy. The induction motor is the most widely used type of motor because it combines 
                    all the advantages offered by the electrical energy such as low cost, easy of supply and 
                    distribution, clean handling and simple controls - together with those of simple construction 
                    and its great versatility to be adapted to wide ranges of loads and improved efficiencies.</p>
                <p>The most widely used type of electric motor for driving a hydraulic pump is the 3-phase, 
                    squirrel cage induction motor, with Design B electrical characteristics. It is available 
                    in open drip-proof, totally enclosed, and explosion proof frames. Information in this issue 
                    is concerned with frame assignments and with the dimensions of shaft length, diameter, and 
                    height above base.</p>
                <p>A key part of motor interchangeability has been the standardization of frame sizes. 
                    This means that the same horsepower, speed, and enclosure will normally have the same 
                    frame size from different motor manufacturers. Thus, a motor from one manufacturer 
                    can be replaced with a similar motor from another company provided they are both in 
                    standard frame sizes.</p>

                <h3>Amps</h3>
                <p>Full Load Amps</p>
                <p>The amount of current the motor can be expected to draw under full load (torque) conditions is 
                    called Full Load Amps. It is also know as nameplate amps.</p>
                <p>Locked Rotor Amps</p>
                <p>Also known as starting inrush, this is the amount of current the motor can be expected to draw under
                    starting conditions when full voltage is applied.</p>
                <p>Service Factor Amps</p>
                <p>This is the amount of current the motor will draw when it is subjected to a percentage of overload 
                    equal to the service factor on the nameplate of the motor. For example, many motors will have a service 
                    factor of 1.15, meaning that the motor can handle a 15% overload. The service factor amperage is the amount 
                    of current that the motor will draw under the service factor load condition.</p>
                <p>Efficiency</p>
                <p>Efficiency is the percentage of the input power that is actually converted to work output from the motor shaft. 
                    Full load efficiency is stamped on the nameplate of most domestically-produced electric motors.</p>

                <h3>Torque.</h3>
                <p>Torque is the twisting force exerted by the shaft of a motor. Torque is measured in pound inches, 
                    pound feet, and on small motors, in terms of ounce inches.</p>
                <p>Full load torque</p>
                <p>Full load torque is the rated continuous torque that the motor can support without overheating within its time rating.</p>
                <p>Peak torque </p>
                <p>Many types of loads such as reciprocating compressors
                    have cycling torques where the amount of torque required varies depending on the position of the machine. 
                    The actual maximum torque requirement at any point is called the peak torque requirement. Peak torques are involved 
                    in things such as punch presses and other types of loads where an oscillating torque requirement occurs.</p>
                <p>Pull out torque</p>
                <p>Also known as breakdown torque, this is the maximum amount of torque that is available from the motor shaft when the 
                    motor is operating at full voltage and is running at full speed. The load is then increased until the maximum point is 
                    reached.</p>
