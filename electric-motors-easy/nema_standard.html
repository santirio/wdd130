                <h2>NEMA Motors Standard</h2>
                <p>The motors NEMA.
                    A important achievement has been the standardization of motors by the National 
                    Electric Manufacturers Association (NEMA).
                    Motors, like suits of clothes, shoes and hats, come in various sizes to match the 
                    requirements of the application. In general, the frame size gets larger with increasing 
                    horsepowers or with decreasing speeds. In order to promote standardization in the motor 
                    industry, NEMA (National Electrical Manufacturers Association) prescribes standard frame 
                    sizes for certain dimensions of standard motors. For example, a motor with a frame size 
                    of 56, will always have a shaft height above the base of 3-1/2 inches.
                    The standardization effort over the last forty years has resulted in one original 
                    grouping of frame sizes called “original”. In 1952, new frame assignments were made. 
                    These were called “U frames”. The current “T frames” were introduced in 1964. 
                    “T” frames are the current standard and most likely will continue to be for some time 
                    in the future. Even though “T” frames were adopted in 1964, there are still a great 
                    many “U” frame motors in service that will have to be replaced in the future.
